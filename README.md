# Pawpal 🐾

**Pawpal** is a mobile app designed to improve the lives of street dogs by connecting people who want to help, adopt, or donate for their welfare. The app allows users to upload street dogs, adopt them, and create fundraisers for their care.

## Problem Statement
Delhi’s stray dog situation is a growing concern. Supreme Court directives focus on removing stray dogs from public spaces such as schools and hospitals and sheltering them after sterilization and vaccination. **Pawpal** addresses this problem by making adoption and donations easier and helping the stray dog population get proper care.
